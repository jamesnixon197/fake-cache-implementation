# fake-cache-implementation
A fake cache implementation to practice caching techniques.

This caching implementation makes use of doubly linked lists & maps to ensure the cache methods have a time complexity of O(1).

This implementation uses the LRU algorithm to ensure the cache gets updated appropriately.
